   As of Spring 2020, I am taking CSCI 395.86, a course in Open Source Software   
Development. I'm interested in this course, specifically for the latter half of   
the course's title. Despite not declaring a Computer Science major, I'm interested  
in developing programming skills. Although I have an interest in editing websites  
(I even took an internship where I was archiving posts and fixing links), I was also  
interested in some form of software development. That's probably why I'm also taking  
a game programming course this semester, alongside this one. 

  What especially interested me was the concept of open-source software. I firmly   
believe in the concept of software that belongs to all, especially to anyone capable     
of understanding and contributing to it. It's an important invention of this modern    
day, and I hope I learn from this class the skills to make my own open-source software     
or at least the skills to contribute to an open source software. My biggest hope is to  
learn enough to help build or contribute to software that could be browser extensions or    
alternatives to websites I use.
