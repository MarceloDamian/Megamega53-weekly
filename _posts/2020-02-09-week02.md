Certain ways I would like to contribute to the open source projects in this course  
is by mostly editing or troubleshooting some programming scripts. Especially if   
itâ€™s in a language that I am very familiar with such as Python.

I believe that working in Open Source will be very beneficial for me. I think that participating in numerous projects will allow me to experience and understand web programming in a manner that goes beyond just web design. Also, because working with open source is more social, due to the attitude of contributing when interacting, I can develop more skills relating to web programming, like building an extension or creating a series of web pages. Close communication is also beneficial, for if you have any questions you can instantly ask for troubleshooting help. Because of the nature of FOSS and how it benefits in teaching further web programming, I feel that FOSS will greatly benefit me for a career related to web programming, as it can encourage me to create personal projects to add to my portfolio and resume, and pretty much help me gain experience.
