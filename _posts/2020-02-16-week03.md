### Week 3

1. Certain skills that I have which can be useful in a FOSS project are:

   * Artistic abilities: creating art for projects that would require visuals. For example, I would excel at creating a browser extension that would open up a png file every time you click on its button or even designing an icon for a browser extension

   * Video Editing: if the project requires videos in its repository (maybe they're tutorials or actually part of the project as some sort of video archive) then I would be able to do it. 

2. One thing that is most interesting to me is drawing. I have loved drawing  
throughout most of my life. I'm especially experienced in character design, and overall cartooning. I am now trying to practice and get into 2D animation. I used to draw traditionally, but starting from the 2010s I started drawing digitally. (It saves some papers.) Digital art software also gives me a variety of tools to use so I can draw and digitally paint as well.
