### Week 3

1. Certain skills that I have which can be useful in a FOSS project is creating art  
for projects that would require visuals, like a browser extension that would open up  
a png file every time you click on its button. Even designing an icon for a browser  
extension is something I can do for a FOSS project. Another skill I can contribute is  
video editing if the project requires videos in its repository (maybe they're tutorials  
or actually part of the project as some sort of video archive). 

2. The things that are most interesting to me is drawing to be honest. I loved drawing  
throughout most of my life. I'm especially experienced in character design, and overall  
cartooning. I am now trying to practice and get into 2D animation. I used to draw traditionally,  
but starting from the 2010s I started drawing digitally. (It saves some papers.) Digital art  
software also gives me a variety of tools to use so I can draw and digitally paint as well.
