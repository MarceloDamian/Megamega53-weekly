### Week 5

#### What was hard about the project?
* Sometimes it is hard to find discussions in pull requests or the specific topic that the question in the evaluation is asking for, even if there is discussion.

#### What did you learn in the project?
* I learned how involved the maintainers of the projects are when discussing with newcoming contributors. And I also learned about the type of qualifications of getting your pull requests accepted, such thorough reviews of the issue.


#### How interested are you in this project?
* I want to support this project due to it being a free educational tool and also being based around coding, a subject I'm interested in. But so far there wasn't anything that I didn't expect from what I imagined looking and reviewing at repositories would be like.

Whenever I contribute to a project in a team, I feel like I work best managing and updating posts or any other type of code within the project. But for me, the hardest task was creating a new branch within the repository. However, I was surprised at how easy it was to create files and fork repositories. The latter was actually an accidental discovery when I first tried to create my blog.
