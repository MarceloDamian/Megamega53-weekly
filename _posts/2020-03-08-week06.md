  For the semester project, my partner and I are still deciding on which project to do. At first we both thought that Godot would be a good project to contribute to, but then I got worried that I might not contribute much to the project because that project ran on C and C++, which were both languages that I wasn't completely skilled with. Although my partner seemed to have more experience with the programming language than me, I'm worried that I might lag behind and slow him down with the progress of the semester project. Also the Godot Engine project seemed like it's expecting help from more experienced contributors, judging by its CONTRIBUTING and README files. While friendly and inviting, they don't offer examples of ways to contribute, but instead notify the reader of any troubleshooting whenever they pull requests, commit or anything else relating to Git. 
  I've been taking a Game Programming course this semester, and last class they showed an open source project called Itch.io, where it functions as a distribution hub where beginner indie game developers share their game, or at least a demo of their game, to the internet community. Going through its repository, it seemed more straight-forward compared to the Godot engine's repository.
