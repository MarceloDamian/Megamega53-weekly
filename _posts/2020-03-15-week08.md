*For the question how does the remote distance classes are affecting you?

As much as I hope the coronavirus situation will let up, the remote distance classes are actually very convenient for me.
I commute from New Jersey and usually I had to leave early in order to get to this class on time. The online class means I can sleep
more (lol). .
Also hearing the lecture with my earphones, actually helps me focus more. I have problems with attention, so this class can help me
more.
