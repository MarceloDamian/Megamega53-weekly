Wikipedia

In the beginning of the week I've made edits to two Wikipedia articles, as seen in my Contributions page. I've written more in these two edits than my last previous two Wikipedia edits. One edit was towards a section about a movie's soundtrack. I wanted to make it more streamlined, so I rearranged the sentences to an order that I think flows much better. Before, the paragraph started off talking about a scene with music that wasn't about a soundtrack. So I moved that sentence to later in the paragraph and immediately made the sentences summarizing the soundtrack's content and release as the first sentences instead. My next edit was towards a list of unofficial fanmade games for a video game franchise. This edit was my first time that I added a source, which was the first time I searched for accurate sources for a Wikipedia edit, while making sure that the citation was proper. I hoped to get used to citation by finding more articles requiring sources, or adding edits that would require sources anyways.

Blog Edits

I've edited two blogs in the first half of this week, making two contributions to the latter blog. Two edits in each blogs were minor grammar edits containing comma additions and some capitalizations to some names. Later in the week, I edited a third blog with capitalizations, comma additions and more grammar checking. In the second blog I edited, I was confused about the grammar of one sentence. The sentence started with a "However", related to its previous sentence, but it didn't contrast it and instead seemed like it was expanding it. So I opened an issue with the author of the blog asking if maybe its best to change the adverbial conjunction. Like switching "However" with "Therefore".
