#### Wikipedia

In the beginning of the week I've made edits to two Wikipedia articles, as seen in my Contributions page. I've written more in these two edits than my last previous two Wikipedia edits. One edit was towards a section about a movie's soundtrack. I wanted to make it more streamlined, so I rearranged the sentences to an order that I think flows much better. Before, the paragraph started off talking about a scene with music that wasn't about a soundtrack. So I moved that sentence to later in the paragraph and immediately made the sentences summarizing the soundtrack's content and release as the first sentences instead. My next edit was towards a list of unofficial fanmade games for a video game franchise. This edit was my first time that I added a source, which was the first time I searched for accurate sources for a Wikipedia edit, while making sure that the citation was proper. I hoped to get used to citation by finding more articles requiring sources, or adding edits that would require sources anyways. The last Wikipedia edit I did for the week of April 5-12 was on an article about rail transport in fiction, in which I added some entries and some more details.

#### Blog Edits

I've edited two blogs in the first half of this week, making two contributions to the latter blog. Two edits in each blogs were minor grammar edits containing comma additions and some capitalizations to some names. Later in the week, I edited a third blog with capitalizations, comma additions and more grammar checking. In the second blog I edited, I was confused about the grammar of one sentence. The sentence started with a "However", related to its previous sentence, but it didn't contrast it and instead seemed like it was expanding it. So I opened an issue with the author of the blog asking if maybe its best to change the adverbial conjunction. Like switching "However" with "Therefore".

#### Godot

For Godot, my team and I made a big progress by starting to contribute to the repository itself. Though we didn't contribute to the main repository, we contributed to a repository specifically for demos and projects. I first opened up an issue I found about a demo that wouldn't open properly despite installing it. The core contributors responded and told me that I should bring the issue to the demo's very own repository. I did that while being surprised that each demo project and template from Godot has their own repository. My next contribution was providing for a request for a clean version of some pictures from a request thread. The request thread had pictures that was offered as a new map for a 2D shader template from Godot. However, the maps had white artifacts so users from the thread were asking for clean edits of the map. Even though the request thread was from 2018, I provided clean edits by using Clip Studio Paint to remove the artifacts. Originally after posting in the thread with the zip file containing the clean edits, I opened a proposal asking if they would take my clean edits. However, through the advice of my professor, I closed that proposal as it would probably not be a suitable way to import my edits besides answering the thread with the zip file.
