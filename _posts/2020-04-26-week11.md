#### Godot

  During this week I have been looking for issues to work on, and this time outside of the repository for the demos because there are more issues in the other repository I can look at. This Saturday, I have been looking at the godot-docs repository. One hypothetical issue I can resolve is helping redesign the documentations for a future version of Godot.
